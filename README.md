# 42 header

this directory will enable you to generate 42 header for .c files and Makefiles

those files should be pasted in your .vimrc directory ```~/.vimrc```

if this folder does not exist, please create it at this exact adress, otherwise, you will have to change the paths in the vimrc file 

# save.sh

just run ```sh save.sh "your comment"```
this will push your files to your git and will add cool emojis to your commit comment ðŸ™Œ
